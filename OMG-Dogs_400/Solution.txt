We are given a pcapng file, but to read it with wireshark, we need it to be a pcap file.
So we can just convert it online. Once we get the pcap file, we can tell that all the packets
are icmp packets. We can extract the data from it and decode the hex with extract_data.py

Binwalk tells us that the output of extract_data.py is a gzip archive, which we can
extract using

    $ binwalk --dd='.*' -e bin

Now, we are given a POSIX tar archive, which we can also extract:

    $ tar xvf 9B

Viewing the screenshot that comes out of the extract gives us the flag.

flag{I_c_u_Ping}
