The problem name sounds a lot like 'scoreboard', so if we go to the scoreboard page,
we can reconstruct the flag by viewing the different parts in the console and source code.

part_1: flag{
part_2: th4t_m0ment_
part_3: wh3n_ther3_
part_4: 1$_a_fl4g_1n_th3_scorebo4rd_s0urce
part_5: }

flag{th4t_m0ment_wh3n_ther3_1$_a_fl4g_1n_th3_scorebo4rd_s0urce}
