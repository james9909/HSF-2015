A quick google search of the quote yields this nice paragraph.


    I prefer the term digital forensic investigation over digital forensics because the process that is
associated with "digital forensics" is much more similar to a physical crime scene
investigation than to physical forensics. The "physical forensics" are used to answer a more
limited set of questions than a general investigation. Physical forensics is used to "identify"
a substance, which determines the class of the substance. For example, a red liquid could be
identified as blood or fruit juice. Physical forensics are also used to "individualize" an
object, which determines the unique source of an object. For example, blood from a crime scene
could be compared with a sample from a suspect to determine if the two blood samples are the
same or two bullets could be compared to determine if they were shot from the same gun.
