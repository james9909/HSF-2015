If we go to Meghan Caiazzo's twitter and look at her followers, searching for "caiazzo"
leads us to 2 people, "Carly Caiazzo" and "the real bobby".

Considering that Meghan has a twin brother, it's probably not Carly, so let's go check out Bobby's twitter.
Sure enough, if we look at his most recent tweet, we find the flag.
