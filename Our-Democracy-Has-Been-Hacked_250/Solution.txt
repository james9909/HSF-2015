This is very similar to the CSAW 2015 Lawn Care Simulator challenge, except the .git
folder is public, so we could easily get the files using a browser. However, I like my scripts,
so I used those to reconstruct the git objects.

Retrieving the index.html swap/backup files did not help, since the contents within were red herrings.
What you needed to do was reconstruct the log, and if you construct it fully, viewing the log gives the flag.
