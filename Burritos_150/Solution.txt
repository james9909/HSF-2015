The first several parts of the problem are pretty easy to get. Simply follow the TCP stream
of the first packet:

220 ubuntu FTP server (Version 6.4/OpenBSD/Linux-ftpd-0.17) ready.
USER ctf
331 Password required for ctf.
PASS password
230 User ctf logged in.
SYST
215 UNIX Type: L8 (Linux)
TYPE I
200 Type set to I
PORT 172,30,1,29,168,115
200 PORT command successful.
STOR /home/ctf/Desktop/file.docx
150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for '/home/ctf/Desktop/file.docx'.
226 Transfer complete.
QUIT
221 Goodbye.

For the doc file, I used NetworkMiner to retrieve the file, but I couldn't open it up on my laptop,
so I converted it to a pdf. Opening the pdf will give us the answer to the last question, completing the flag.

flag{172.30.1.24_ctf_password_/home/ctf/Desktop/file.docx_Burrito-Pie}
