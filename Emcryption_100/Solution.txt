The problem requires solving the substitution cipher, but it is fairly easy to do.
A quick guess tells us that the last sentence reads "P.S. The flag is __________"
and that the first sentence is "Dear _____". If you decode the letter, you realize that
there are 2 spots that you could not easily guess, and that is the first letter of the flag
and the person's name. "Z" and "J" are the only leftover letters, and trying each of them as
the flag shows which one is the flag.
