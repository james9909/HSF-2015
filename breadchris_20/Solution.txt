First, let's go onto his github to see if there's anything interesting there. https://github.com/breadchris

Indeed, we see some interesting commits to his github.io and to the NYU Poly Hack-Night repo:

https://github.com/breadchris/breadchris.github.io/commit/8c0796d1b21b875a44806e6c43b7ce8938f09de9
https://github.com/isislab/Hack-Night/commit/9988439e0702a02c4d3d269cb64f0aa87a6cfff8

Combined, they tell us that the flag is somewhere on the calendar over at http://blog.isis.poly.edu/Hack-Night.

If we go far enough back on the google calendar, we find an event with the flag:
