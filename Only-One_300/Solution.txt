This is a crypto problem with xor, but we don't know the used to encrypt the flag.
Luckily, we do have xortool, which will brute force the encrypted flag anyways.

    $ xortool -o -x encrypt.txt

If grep all the output files for flag, we can find the flag in 50.out.

flag{x0r_lik3_th3r3_i$_n0_t0morrow}
