Looking at the bytes of the file, we can assume that the file is supposed to be a
png. However, the header bytes are incorrect, and we need to correct them.
A correct PNG begin with the following bytes:
89 50 4e 47 0d 0a 1a 0a

However, our file begins with the following bytes:
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

Simply replace the incorrect bytes with the correct ones to fix the png and
get the flag.

flag{@11_@60ut_th3m_Bit$}
