Viewing the file on audacity, we can see that there are 2 streams of audio coming from both
the left and right speakers. The audio coming out of the right speaker is just a bunch of random
noise, but the audio coming from the left contains the flag. Simply listen to the characters
that are being spoken and join them together to make the flag.
